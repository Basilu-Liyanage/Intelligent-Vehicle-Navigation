Intelligent Vehicle Navigation
Overview
The Intelligent Vehicle Navigation project is a cutting-edge system designed to automate vehicle navigation using advanced algorithms and real-time data from sensors. This project integrates artificial intelligence, machine learning, and sensor fusion techniques to enable a vehicle to autonomously navigate its environment while avoiding obstacles, following a path, and making intelligent decisions in real-time.

Features
Autonomous Navigation: Vehicle can navigate from one point to another without human intervention.
Obstacle Detection and Avoidance: Uses sensors such as LIDAR, cameras, or ultrasonic sensors to detect and avoid obstacles.
Path Planning: Calculates the optimal path to the destination using algorithms like A* or Dijkstra's.
Real-time Decision Making: The vehicle makes real-time decisions based on sensor data, traffic, and environmental conditions.
User Interface: Provides a user-friendly interface for monitoring and controlling the vehicle's operation.
Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language for the project.
OpenCV: Used for image processing and object detection.
ROS (Robot Operating System): For handling communication between different components of the vehicle.
LIDAR / Ultrasonic Sensors: For environment mapping and obstacle detection.
TensorFlow / PyTorch: Used for machine learning models that assist in decision-making and environment analysis.
